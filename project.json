  "description": "Synthik is a decentralized platform built on Filecoin’s Synapse SDK that streamlines the creation, sharing, and monetization of high-fidelity synthetic datasets. Every dataset’s lineage is immutably recorded on-chain using Proof-of-Data-Possession, an AI-driven quality gate ensures accuracy and diversity, and data is stored on Filecoin with FilCDN acceleration. USDFc stablecoin enables instant, low-fee license settlement, while one-click pipelines feed verified data directly into AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, or Hugging Face for seamless model training.",
