## Prerequisites

1. **Deploy the contracts first:**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:calibration
   ```

2. **Ensure you have FIL tokens** on Filecoin Calibration testnet for gas fees

3. **Set up environment variables** in `.env` file (see `.env.example`)

- Track transformation lineage
- Verify anonymization quality
- Maintain data utility while protecting privacy

**Run:**

```bash
npm run demo:transform
```

**What you'll see:**

- Data transformation processes
- Privacy protection techniques
- Anonymization quality metrics
- Transformation lineage tracking

## Running All Demos

To run all demos in sequence:

```bash
npm run demo:all
```

This will execute all demo scripts one after another, providing a complete tour of the Synthik system.

## Demo Data

Each demo script creates sample datasets with unique IDs based on timestamps. The scripts are designed to be run multiple times without conflicts.

### Sample Dataset Types Created:

1. **E-commerce Customer Behavior** (Creator demo)
2. **Medical Diagnosis Patterns** (Marketplace demo)
3. **Financial News & Market Data** (Lineage demo)
4. **Enhanced Financial Sentiment** (Lineage demo - derived)
5. **Anonymized Healthcare Records** (Transformation demo)

## Understanding the Output

### ‚úÖ Success Messages

Green checkmarks indicate successful operations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Messages

Yellow warnings indicate expected failures or optional operations

### üìä Data Displays

Information about created datasets, contracts, and transactions

### üéâ Completion Summaries

Final status and next steps for each demo

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Provenance Tracking

- Complete dataset lineage from creation to usage
- Model training history and accuracy tracking
- Data transformation and augmentation records

### Access Control

- Manual access granting
- Automatic rule-based access
- Role-based permissions (VERIFIER, CURATOR, etc.)

### Economic Layer

- Dataset marketplace with pricing
- Royalty distribution to creators
- License management and tracking

### Data Integrity

- Merkle root verification
- Immutable provenance records
- Cryptographic proof of data authenticity

### Privacy Protection

- Data anonymization and transformation
- Privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Please run deployment first"**

   - Run `npm run deploy:calibration` before demos

2. **Gas estimation failed**

   - Ensure you have sufficient FIL tokens
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Access control failures**

   - Some operations require specific roles
   - Warnings are expected for role-restricted operations

4. **Marketplace purchase failures**

   - Expected without actual USDFC tokens
   - Demonstrates the purchase flow structure

5. **No listings found**
   - Run the marketplace demo first to create listings
   - Use `npm run demo:marketplace` before `npm run demo:listings`

## Next Steps

After running the demos:

1. **Explore the contracts** - Check the deployed contract addresses in `deployments.json`

2. **Integrate with frontend** - Use the contract addresses and ABIs in your frontend application

3. **Create real datasets** - Use the patterns shown in demos to create actual datasets

4. **Set up USDFC tokens** - For real marketplace transactions

5. **Configure access rules** - Set up automatic access rules for your use cases

6. **Analyze marketplace data** - Use the listings script to monitor market activity

## Contract Addresses

After deployment, find contract addresses in:

- `deployments.json` - Complete deployment information
- Console output - Displayed during deployment

## Support

For questions or issues:

- Review the contract documentation in `/contracts`
- Check the deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Examine the contract source code for detailed functionality
